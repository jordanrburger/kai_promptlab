# Kai PromptLab 👩🏻‍🔬

Welcome to the PromptLab! Here's your quick step-by-step guide to help you get started with the app.

## Introduction
PromptLab is a tool designed to assist you in generating prompts for natural language processing tasks using OpenAI's models. Connect to your Keboola storage, preview the data, test different prompts and find the one that fits your data best.

## Getting Started

### 🔄 Connecting to Keboola Storage
1. Start by connecting to the Keboola storage. To do this, you will need your API token. Navigate to the "Settings" section in your Keboola account and find the "API Tokens" tab. For more detailed information, refer to the [documentation](https://help.keboola.com/management/project/tokens/).

2. Once you have obtained your API token, use it to connect to Keboola storage through the app. You will be able to select the specific bucket and table you want to work with.

### 📊 Previewing Your Data
After connecting to the selected table, you should see a preview of your data. Ensure that you are working with the correct table before proceeding to create prompts and analyze the results.

## Using the App

### 🗝️ Obtaining an OpenAI API Key
To use the PromptLab, you will need an OpenAI API key. You can obtain it by visiting the [OpenAI platform](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys).

### 🛠️ Improving Prompts
If you have ideas but are uncertain about the wording of your prompts, PromptLab has you covered. Simply enter your idea, and click the "Improve" button. The app will provide you with an improved version of your prompt that adheres to prompt engineering best practices.

### 🤹‍♂️ Testing Prompts
This is where you can experiment and fine-tune your prompts. You can input 1-3 prompts to run with your data, and each prompt comes with its own settings. You can adjust parameters such as temperature to control the creativity of the responses or compare results across different models. Additionally, you can specify the portion of your dataset you want to analyze.

### 🎢 Running the App
Once you are satisfied with your prompts and settings, click the "OKaaaAAAaaAYYYy LETS GO" button. The app will work its magic, running all the prompts and returning the responses.

### 🔍 Analyzing Results
Review the responses generated by the app and determine which prompt works best for your data. Pay attention to the responses' similarity score to identify areas where prompts may seem contradictory. This can help you refine your prompts and gain insights into potential model challenges.
